My personal homepage and portfolio

This repo is my website for my art and design portfolio.

Currently, it is under construction and the live link shows a version that I'm moving away from. 

The current piece that is under construction is http://www.BeckySChapin.com/test/index.html
I pulled a free template ( attribution required and retained - https://github.com/ajlkn ) from online and I'm doing the
necessary edits to personalize it to my needs.

It's letting me stretch my html/css knowledge, but still have a finished project that is more 'complete' than it would
have been if I started from scratch, right now.
